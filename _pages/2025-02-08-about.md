## What I Do
My name is Cong Wang, I am from China and currently live in California, the United States. I am a professional Linux kernel developer and maintainer of networking traffic control subsystem. I have been working on Linux kernel since 2009 and have contributed to many open source projects. For Linux kernel alone, I have contributed over 1000 patches.

During my spare time, I spend a lot of time on indoor bouldering and currently I can climb most V7's.

I also love reading books and watching movies. My favorite topic of reading is personal development and I offer my services for coaching and mentoring personal development as well.

## Blog

This blog focuses on various technical topics, personal development and life. I write about various areas including but not limited to Linux kernel, networking, system performance, and personal development. This blog only represents my own view, does not represent the views of my employer.
