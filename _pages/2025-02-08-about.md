## Who I Am

I'm Cong Wang, a software engineer and entrepreneur based in California. Originally from China, I've spent my career working at the intersection of operating systems, networking, and performance optimization.

I'm currently the Founder and CEO of [Multikernel Technologies](https://multikernel.io/){:target="_blank"}, and Co-Founder and CTO of [Agentry](https://agentry.site/){:target="_blank"}. Before starting my own companies, I worked at ByteDance, Twitter, and Red Hat, where I led teams and contributed to large-scale infrastructure projects.

I'm also a Linux kernel maintainer for the networking traffic control subsystem. Since 2009, I've contributed over 1,000 patches to the kernel and spoken at conferences including Linux Plumbers, Netdev, and Open Source Summit.

## Beyond Work

Outside of work, I spend a lot of time on indoor bouldering (currently climbing most V7's), reading, and watching movies. I'm particularly interested in personal development and enjoy exchanging ideas on the topic. If you're looking for advice or just want to have a conversation, feel free to reach out.

## This Blog

I write about technical topics, personal development, and life. The views expressed here are my own.
