title: 海上钢琴师
---
<p><br />
</p>
<p>今天终于把觊觎已久的电影《海上钢琴师》给看完了。这果然是一部好电影，忍不住想为里面的主人公1900喝彩。</p>
<p>他其实是一个很简单的人，音乐就是他的全部事业，那艘船就是他的整个世界，对他来说这已经非常足够了。他甚至认为外面世界的东西会妨碍他的这种生活，所以，至始至终，1900都待在船上。曾有一次，他也想为了自己喜欢的女人去下一次船，可终于还是放弃了，他实在是不能适应陆地人复杂的生活。他和Max最后那段经典的对话可以说明一切。</p>
<pre>All that city. You just couldn’t see the end to it. The end please.
You please just show me where it ends It was all very fine on that
gangway. And I was grand too, in my overcoat. I cut quite a figure.
And I was getting off. Guaranteed. There was no problem. It wasn’t
what I saw that stopped me, Max. It was what I didn’t see. You
understand that What I didn’t see. In all that sprawling city there
was everything except an end. There was no end. What I did not see
was where the whole thing came to an end. The end of the world...

Take a piano. The keys begin, the keys end. You know there are
eighty-eight of them, nobody can tell you any different. They are
not infinite. You are infinite. And on these keys the music that you
can make is infinite. I like that. That I can live by.

You get me up on that gangway and you’re rolling out in front of me
a keyboard of millions of keys, millions and billions of keys that
never end, and that’s the truth, Max. That they never end. That
keyboard is infinite. And if that keyboard is infinite, then on that
keyboard there is no music you can play. You’re sitting on the wrong
bench. That’s God’s piano.

Christ! Did, did you see the streets Just the streets… There were
thousands of them! And how do you do it down there How do you
choose just one One woman, one house, one piece of land to call
your own, one landscape to look at, one way to die...

All that world is weighing down on me, you don’t even know where it
comes to an end, and aren’t you ever just scared of breaking apart
at the thought of it The enormity of living it.

I was born on this ship, and the world passed me by, but two
thousand people at a time. And there were wishes here, but never
more than fit between prow and stern. You played out your happiness,
but on a piano that was not infinite. I learned to live that way.

Land? Land is a ship too big for me. It’s a woman too beautiful;
it’s a voyage too long, a perfume too strong. It’s a music I don’t
know how to make. I could never get off this ship. At best, I can
step off my life. After all, I don’t exist for anyone. You’re an
exception, Max, you’re the only one who knows I’m here. You’re a
minority, and you better get used to it. Forgive me, my friend, but
I’m not getting off.</pre>
<p>里面有三个场景让我记忆犹新：一个是1900在狂风乱作时在大厅里旋转着弹着钢琴，另一个是1900在和“爵士乐之父”比赛时因为击键频率过高让周围的人惊讶过度，而且他把香烟放到钢琴里面的钢丝上居然都能点着，最后一个当然是1900和Max的最后对话，说明他为什么宁可舍弃生命也不愿离开那艘船。</p>
<p>我觉得应该像1900那样去生活。</p>
