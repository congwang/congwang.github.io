title: I Try
---
<p><br />

<p>Sung By "Macy Gray"</p>
<p>Games, changes and fears<br />
When will they go from here<br />
When will they stop<br />
I belive that fate has brought us here<br />
And we should be together babe<br />
But we're not<br />
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you<br />
And I'll try to keep my cool, but I'm feenin'</p>
<p><strong>I try to say goodbye and I choke<br />
Try to walk away and I stumble<br />
Though I try to hide it, it's clear<br />
My world crumbles when you are not here</strong><br />
Goodbye and I choke<br />
I try to walk away and I stumble<br />
Though I try to hide it, it's clear<br />
My world crumbles when you are not here</p>
<p>I may appear to be free<br />
But I'm just a prisoner of your love<br />
And I may seem all right and smile when you leave<br />
But my smiles are just a front<br />
Just a front, hey<br />
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you<br />
And I'll try to keep my cool, but I'm feenin'</p>
<p>I try to say goodbye and I choke<br />
Try to walk away and I stumble<br />
Though I try to hide it, it's clear<br />
My world crumbles when you are not here<br />
Goodbye and I choke<br />
I try to walk away and I stumble<br />
Though I try to hide it, it's clear<br />
My world crumbles when you are not here</p>
<p>Here is my confession<br />
May I be your possession<br />
Boy, I need your touch<br />
Your love, kisses and such<br />
With all my might I try<br />
But this I can't deny<br />
Deny</p>
<p>I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you<br />
(but I'm dreaming of you babe)<br />
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feenin'</p>
<p>I try to say goodbye and I choke (yeah)<br />
Try to walk away and I stumble<br />
Though I try to hide, it's clear<br />
My world crumbles when you are not near<br />
(when you are not near aahh)<br />
Goodbye and I choke (yeah, yeah, yeah)<br />
I try to walk away and I stumble (hey, hey, hey)<br />
Though I try to hide it, it's clear (say it Lord)<br />
My world crumbles when you are not here</p>
<p>Goodbye and I choke (I'm choking)<br />
I try to walk away and I stumbe<br />
Though I try to hide it, it's clear<br />
My world crumbles when you are not near<br />
(when you are not near, yeah, yeah yeah)<br />
Yeah, yeah..</p>
