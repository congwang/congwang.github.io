<p>Since some people may be still wondering where I will work...</p>
<p>Well, after a rather long-time interview, finally, I got a very nice job from <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Redhat</a> Beijing as a junior kernel developer. So working on Linux kernel will be my formal work, instead of a hobby in my spare time. This is really a challenge for me. How nice! :)</p>
<p>I want to thank every people I met in Redhat, especially, I want to give my HUGE thanks to <a href="http://www.kernel.sg/" target="_blank">Eugene Teo</a>! Without his recommendation and encouragement, it is impossible for me to get this job.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I would like to thank all of my friends in Beijing, thanks for their kind help during my stay in Beijing!</p>
<p>I am just a lucky dog! ;-)</p>
