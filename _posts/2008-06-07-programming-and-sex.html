<p>有这么一句甚出名的话："Software is like sex: It's better when it's free." 今天才知道，原来是<a href="http://www.businessreviewonline.com/os/archives/2008/06/the_10_best_lin.html" target="_blank">Linus说</a>的。。。于是，solidot上有人由此推出：<a href="http://linux.solidot.org/linux/08/06/07/0959208.shtml" target="_blank">使用盗版像是被诱奸</a>。</p>
<p>在编程这方面，其实和sex相关的“名言”还挺多，整理如下：</p>
<p>"<a href="http://push.cx/2006/programming-is-like-sex" target="_blank">Programming is like sex</a>: one mistake and you're providing support for a lifetime."<br />

<p>"How C++ is like teenage sex:<br />
It is on everyone's mind all the time.<br />
Everyone talks about it all the time.<br />
Everyone thinks everyone else is doing it.<br />
Almost no one is really doing it.<br />
The few who are doing it are: A. Doing it poorly. B. Sure it will be better next time. C. Not practising it safely."</p>
<p>"UNIX is sexist<br />
Type 'man' and help is given<br />
woman is not found</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>UNIX is like sex<br />
After it goes down on you<br />
You have to 'fsck' it</p>
<p>[...]</p>
