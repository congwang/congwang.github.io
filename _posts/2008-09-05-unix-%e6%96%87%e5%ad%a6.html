<a href="http://insecure.org/stf/scoville_unix_as_literature.txt" target="_blank">这里</a>有一篇非常精彩的文章，论述了为什么UNIX才是真正能给你自由的操作系统，UNIX的“文学性”，“道”，艺术等等，里面的很多观点说出了我的心里话！强烈推荐！</p>
<p>特摘取几句我喜欢的：</p>
<pre>UNIX programmers express themselves in a rich vocabulary of system
utilities and command-line arguments, along with a flexible, varied
grammar and syntax.

The one-size-fits-all, point-and-click,
we've-already-anticipated-all-your-needs world of NT had me yearning
for those obscure command-line flags and man -k.

I wanted to craft my own solutions from my own toolbox, not have my
ideas slammed into the visually homogenous, prepackaged, Soviet world
of Microsoft Foundation Classes.

In a literary light, if UNIX is the Great Novel, Perl is the
Cliffs Notes.

Mastery of UNIX, like mastery of language, offers real freedom. The
price of freedom is always dear, but there's no
substitute. Personally, I'd rather pay for my freedom than live in a
bitmapped, pop-up-happy dungeon like NT.</pre>
