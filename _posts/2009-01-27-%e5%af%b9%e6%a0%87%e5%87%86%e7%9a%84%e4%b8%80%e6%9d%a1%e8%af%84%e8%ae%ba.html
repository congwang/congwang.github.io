<blockquote><p>The standard is written in a variant of English sometimes called<br />
standardese.  It's designed (or at least intended) to be<br />
absolutely precise and unambiguous, even at the cost of<br />
understandability.  It doesn't always succeed with its intent,<br />
but in all cases, precision and a lack of ambiguity have<br />
precedence over readability.</p></blockquote>
