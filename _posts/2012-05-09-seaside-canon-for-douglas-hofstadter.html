<p>读过<a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1291204/">《集异璧》</a>的同学一定对里面的“卡农”印象深刻，这里有人又专门写了一首“卡农”的诗，窃以为更好。转过来欣赏一下。</p>
<p>SEASIDE CANON, for Douglas Hofstadter</p>
<p>by Julia Galef</p>
<p>~<br />
The ocean was still.<br />
In an empty sky, two gulls turned lazy arcs, and<br />
their keening cries echoed<br />
off the cliff and disappeared into the sea.<br />
When the child, scrambling up the rocks, slipped<br />
out of her parents' reach,<br />
they called to her. She was already<br />
so high, but those distant peaks beyond --<br />
they called to her.  She was already<br />
out of her parents' reach<br />
when the child, scrambling up the rocks, slipped<br />
off the cliff and disappeared into the sea.<br />
Their keening cries echoed<br />
in an empty sky. Two gulls turned lazy arcs, and<br />
the ocean was still.<br />
