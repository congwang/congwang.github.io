<p>  My friends all think<br />
    that I'm a neb<br />
  Cause I spend much time<br />
    here on the web</p>
<p>  The good things here<br />
    I do not abuse<br />
  Except lots of time<br />
    on hacker news</p>
<p>  I don't read reddit<br />
    I will not digg<br />
  I'm not on facebook<br />
    My work's too big</p>
<p>  I do not text<br />
    I do not tweet<br />
  I just work on<br />
    Things that are neat</p>
<p>  I check email<br />
    throughout the day<br />
  But there are no games<br />
    that I will play</p>
<p>  My phone's on vibrate<br />
    I do not chat<br />
  My work is really<br />
    Where it's at</p>
<p>  Knuth and Turing<br />
    are my big heroes<br />
  I love to move<br />
    Ones and zeros</p>
<p>  My head is down<br />
    I'm in the mode<br />
  Don't bother me<br />
    I have to code</p>
<p>  Those who need me<br />
    leave voicemail<br />
  I'm much too busy<br />
    trying not to fail</p>
<p>  I learn on-line<br />
    and from my schools<br />
  But I must avoid<br />
    all sorts of trolls</p>
<p>  I can't believe<br />
    I wrote this ode<br />
  When I have so much<br />
    I have to code</p>
<p>  I'm not an addict<br />
    I have no drug<br />
  I've got to go<br />
    To fix a bug</p>
<p></p>
