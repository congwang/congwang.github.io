<p>The glitter of official lies and the epic splendor of the thought-numbing funeral of J.F.K. confuse the eye and confound the understanding.</p>
<p>Hitler said:"The bigger the lie, the more people will believe it."Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed lonely man who wanted attention and got it by killing a President was only the first in a long line of patsies.</p>
<p>当局在撒谎，诗史般的肯尼迪葬礼迷惑了我们的双眼和头脑。希特勒说：越大的谎言越有人相信。一个疯狂的无名之辈，想出风头暗杀了总统，这只是一长串名单中的第一个替罪羊。</p>
<p>In later years, Bobby Kennedy,Martin Luther King....men whose commitment to change and peace....made them dangerous to men committed to war, would follow....also killed by such lonely crazed men.</p>
<p>Men who remove all guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner. We've all become Hamlets in our country,children of a slain father-leader. whose killers still possess the throne.</p>
<p>近年来，肯尼迪、马丁路德金凡是想改革想和平的人，都是那些向往战争权贵们的眼中钉。这些人也同样被疯狂、孤独的个人杀害。这些毫无意义的个人愚蠢行为使我们毫无内疚之感。我们都成了哈姆雷特认贼作父，而凶手同样占据着皇位。</p>
<p>The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the American Dream.He forces on us the appalling questions:Of what is our Constitution made?</p>
<p>What are our lives worth?What is the future of a democracy..?where a President can be assassinated under suspicious circumstances..while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles? How many more political murders  disguised as heart attacks......suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?How many plane and car crashes will occur...before they are exposed for what they are?</p>
<p>而肯尼迪总统和他被害的那些秘密终于与我们在我们的美国梦中相遇了，它向我们提出这样一个问题，我们的宪法核心是什么，我们生命的价值又是什么呢？一个国家的总统被杀害，在众多疑问面前，它的司法机构只会在那里发抖，那么这个国家的民主又是什么呢？还有多少政治谋杀被说成是：心脏病发作、自杀、癌症和过量吸毒，还有多少飞机失事和车祸将发生在事情暴露的前夜呢？</p>
<p>"Treason doth never prosper," wrote an English poet.</p>
<p>What's the reason?</p>
<p>For if it prosper, none dare call it treason.</p>
<p>The American public has yetto see the Zapruder film.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The American public has yet to see the real X-rays and autopsy pictures.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Hundreds of documents could help prove this conspiracy.</p>
<p>Why are they being withheld or burned by the government?</p>
<p>When my office or you, the people, asked those questions, demanded evidence, the answer from on high has always been: national security.</p>
<p>What kind of national security do we have when we're robbed of our leaders?</p>
<p>What national security permits the removal..of fundamental power from the people.and validates the ascendancy of invisible government in the U.S.?</p>
<p>That kind of national security.when it smells like it, feels like it, and looks like.you call it what it is: Fascism!</p>
<p>一位英国的诗人曾经这样写道，背信弃义是永远不会成功的，因为他成功了就没人敢叫他背信弃义了。为什么？美国人民到现在为止还没有看录像带，为什么？有成千上万的文件可以作证，为什么却被政府撤掉或者烧毁了呢？每次我的办公室或你们――人民，提出并要求查看证据时，得到的答案永远是：国家安全机密。我们国家的领导人被夺取了生命，还有什么国家安全所言呢？什么样的国家安全被允许夺走人民手中最基本的权利，并允许一个看不见的政府统治我们的美国呢！这样的国家安全，当他看上去如此、闻上去如此、感觉上如此的时候，我们就可以叫他：法西斯主义。</p>
<p>I submit to you that what took place on November 22, 1963.was a coup d'etat.Its most direct and tragic result was the reversal of Kennedy's decision to withdraw from Vietnam.</p>
<p>The war is the biggest  business in America with 80 billion dollars a year.</p>
<p>President Kennedy was murdered by a conspiracy planned at the highest levels of government carried out by fanatical and disciplined cold warriors in the Pentagon and CIA's covert operation apparatus.Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.</p>
<p>我向你们提出发生在1963年11月22日的事件，那是一场政变。它最直接最可悲的后果就是改变了肯尼迪从越南撤军的决定。每年消耗8000亿的战争是美国最大的生意。肯尼迪总统的谋杀案由美国政府的最高层精心策划，由五角大楼和国防部中的战争狂热分子来实施。</p>
<p>It was a public execution,and it was covered up by like-minded people in the Dallas police the Secret Service, the FBI and the White House up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,and Lyndon Johnson who were accomplices after the fact.</p>
<p>胡佛和林登约翰逊，我相信他们是共犯，因前总统被刺而入主白宫的这个总统。</p>
<p>The assassination reduced the President to a transient official.His job is to speak as often as possible of the nation's desire for peace while he acts as a business agent in the Congress for the military and their contractors.</p>
<p>Some people say I'm crazy.Southern caricature seeking higher office.There's a simple way to determine if I am paranoid.Ask the 2 men who profited most from the assassination former President Johnson andyour new President, Nixon to release the 51 CIA documents pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.</p>
<p>Or the secret CIA memo on Oswald's activities in Russia that was destroyed while being photocopied.These documents are yours.The people's property. You pay for it.</p>
<p>But as the government sees you as children....who might be too disturbed to face this reality....or because you might lynch those involved you cannot see these documents for another 75 years.</p>
<p>I'm in my 40's so I'll have shuffled off  this mortal coil by then.</p>
<p>But I'm telling my 8-year-old son to keep himself physically fit. so that one glorious September morning, in 2038, he can go to the National Archives and learn what the CIA and FBI knew.They may push it back then.</p>
<p>It may become a generational affair.Questions passed from parent to child.But some day, somewhere, someone may find out the damn truth.</p>
<p>We better.Or we might just as well buildourselves another government like the Declaration of lndependencesays to, when the old one don't work. Just a bit farther out West.</p>
<p>An American naturalist wrote:"A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against its government."</p>
<p>现在会有人说我是疯了，这有个简单的方法能证明我是否是偏执狂。我要求政府公开中情局51份档案，这些文件都是你们的。不，这些文件是人民的财产，你们为此而付了钱（纳税）。当时政府或许认为你们还是孩子，怕被那些实事吓坏的，或者你们会激动私自处死有关人员。所以在未来75年里你们是看不到这些文件的。我现在40岁，我是看不到了，但我希望我儿子在2038年9月一个阳光明媚的早晨，在国家档案馆翻看这些秘密。这可能成为几代人的事情，不过总会有一天，在某个地方某个人会发现真相。到那时我们自己最好能给自己建立一个新的政府，如独立宣言中所说：<span style="color:red;">任何形式的政府，一旦起破坏作用时，人们便有权给予更换或者废除。</span>一位美国的博物学家说，<span style="color:red;">一位爱国者必须随时随地的准备与政府做斗争，以保护他的国家。</span></p>
<p>I'd hate to be in your shoes today.You have a lot to think about. You'veseen evidence the public hasn't seen.Going back to when we were children.l think most of us in this court thought justice came automatically.</p>
<p>That virtue was its own reward. That good triumphs over evil.But as we get older we know this isn't true.Individual human beings have to create justice, and this is not easy because the truth often poses a threat to power and we often have to fight power at great risk to ourselves.</p>
<p>回想我们的小时候，大多数人会认为正义会自己降落在我们身边，美德是对美德做好的回报，正义总会战胜邪恶。可我们长大后才知道，事情并非不都是真的，每个人都必须为正义而斗争，而这并不容易。因为真理总会引起权势们的恐慌，我们不得不冒着风险与权势们斗争。</p>
<p>People like S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers, Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe, have all taken that risk and they've all come forward.</p>
<p>I have here some $8,000 in these letters sent from all over the country. Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, invalids.These are people who cannot afford to send money but do.People who drive cabs, who nurse in hospitals, who see their kids go to Vietnam.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they care.</p>
<p>Because they want the truth.</p>
<p>Because they want their country back.</p>
<p>Because it still belongs to us.as long as the people fight for what they believe in.</p>
<p>The truth is the most important value we have because if it doesn't endure, if the government murders truth if we cannot respect these people then this is not the country I was born in, or the country I want to die in.</p>
<p><span style="color:red;">我们只要为自己的信仰而斗争，这个国家依然是我们的。寻求真理仍然是我们最重要的人生价值，如果真理已经受到政府谋杀，人民不在受到尊重，那这个地方就不是我们出生的那个国家，肯定也不会是我将与之终身厮守的那个国家。</span></p>
<p>Tennyson wrote:"Authority forgets a dying king."</p>
<p>This was never more true than for John F. Kennedy whose murder was probably one of the most terrible moments in the history of our country.</p>
<p>丁尼斯写到：当权者忘记了死去的国王。这就是肯尼迪遇害最真实的写照，这可能是我们国家历史之上最可怕的历史时刻之一。</p>
<p>We, the people, the jury system sitting in judgment on Clay Shaw represent the hope of humanity against government power. In discharging your duty to bring a first conviction against Clay Shaw, ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.</p>
<p>Do not forget your dying king. Show this world this is still a government of the people, for the people and by the people.Nothing, as long as you live, will ever be more important.</p>
<p>今天的判决代表人民与政府斗争的希望，<span style="color:red;">不要问这个国家能为你做什么，而问你能为这个国家做什么。</span>不要忘却你死去的国王。这个政府依然还是一个民有、民治、民享的政府，只要我们还活着，没有比这更重要的了。</p>
