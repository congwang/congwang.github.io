<p style="text-align:center;">I think that I shall never envision<br />
An op unlovely as division.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">An op whose answer must be guessed<br />
And then, through multiply, assessed;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">An op for which we dearly pay,<br />
In cycles wasted every day.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Division code is often hairy;<br />
Long division's downright scary.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The proofs can overtax your brain,<br />
The ceiling and floor may drive you insane.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Good code to divide takes a Knuthian hero,<br />
But even God can't divide by zero!</p>
